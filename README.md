# Shared-Meals
Ideas for building community in the age of Trumpism.

Invite people from different backgrounds to come together to cook together and share share a meal.
Choose a place where there is a large kitchen where a group of people can work together on preparing food and cleaning up.
A place for children of different ages to hang out and play together would be a plus.
Comfortable places for adults who are not cooking or doing activities with children to play games or talk would also be nice.

### Pick Occasions

Any time is a good time, but it might be nice to do something around times when there are typically festive meals, but probably not at times which collide with the actual dates (or to close so that it seems like a lot of work). It might be nice to do it ahead of time so that participants get a "preview" of what will be happening in other communities.

### Set Expectations

* It will probably be somewhat uncomforatable – that's a good thing.
* Come prepared to listen and learn from each other. You don't have to change your mind to listen, just be open to understanding someone elses experience and world view.
* Be willing to try new things – new food, new ways of cooking, new games, to hear new ideas and viewpoints.

### Afterwards

* Share recipies and information about where to get ingredients.
* Maybe post photos.
* Could have a web site or Facebook page so that a history of events is maintained.
